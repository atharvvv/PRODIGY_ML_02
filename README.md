# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

Welcome to the Customer Segmentation project! This repository contains the code and resources for segmenting customers using K-Means Clustering, enabling targeted marketing strategies.

## Project Overview

In this case study, we delve into the world of customer segmentation through machine learning. Our focus is on simplifying the process of achieving customer segmentation using the K-Means Clustering algorithm in Python. By the end of this project, we've not only tackled the technical aspects but also provided insights into how marketing strategies can be effectively implemented based on these segments.

## Key Objectives

1. Implementation of K-Means Clustering for customer segmentation.
2. Identification of target customer groups for tailored marketing.
3. Real-world applications of data-driven marketing strategies.
